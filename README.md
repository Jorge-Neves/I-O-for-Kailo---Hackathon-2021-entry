# Description
High Noon was the final project of the bootcamp and required us to put into practice all 
we learned in the course of the 9 week curriculum. To do so we developed a MERN stack
web application from scratch and we fully deployed it. High Noon is a productivity app
that was designed with ADHD individuals in mind. This shows in the welcoming UI choices
that don't overwhelm the user with information nor options.


# Live Demo

# Functionalities

## CRUD
The user is able to perform all CRUD operations on the tasks/skills/habits that he wishes to track.

## Stats
In order to have a visual representation of the user's progress when acecessing stats the user will be present with a doughnut diagram (for tasks and skills) and a list of dates for skills, so that they can then evaluate which areas need improving in their productivity journey.

##REST API
Along side all the mongoose logic to store information in our database hosted on heroku. This repository also contains the REST api made with Express.js that connects both the front end and the back end.

## MONGDB
We used mongoDB for our database for this project.

In order to have a visual representation of the user's progress when acecessing stats the user will be present with a doughnut diagram (for tasks and skills) and a list of dates for skills, so that they can then evaluate which areas need improving in their productivity journey.


# Known Issues
When editing existing tasks/skills/habits the web app takes an unsually long time to respond.
Apologies this issue will be fixed in a later version.
